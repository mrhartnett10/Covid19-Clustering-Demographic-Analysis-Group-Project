# Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Data Summary

The Unemployment Insurance weekly claims data summary can be used in any economic analysis of unemployment trends in the United States, in each state. Initial claims measure emerging unemployment and continued weeks claimed measure the number of persons claiming unemployment benefits. The data sheds light on the current economic response to COVID-19 and how the numbers in certain states fluctuate over time. 
 
The data summarizes all weeks between January 2019 and May 2020.
By comparing the 2019 data to the current, 2020 dataset, the information gives way to the impact of COVID-19 on the numbers of individuals filing for unemployment by state.

## Data Organization

The data are collected by state, and organized in a weekly manner starting from January 5th, 2019 ending in May 23rd, 2020. The fifty two and twenty one weeks, for 2019 and 2020 respectively, refer the time period covering filing for unemployment for the previous unemployed week.
