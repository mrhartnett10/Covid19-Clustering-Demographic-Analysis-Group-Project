# Small Business Pulse Survey 

## Data Access: https://portal.census.gov/pulse/data/#downloads

The U.S. Census Bureau launched the Small Business Pulse Survey (Business Pulse) in April 2020, to measure the changes in business conditions on our nation's small businesses during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. For the purpose of this survey, the U.S. Census Bureau defines a small business as a single location business with between 1-499 employees and at least $1,000 in annual revenue. In April 2020, the Census Bureau extracted from the Business Register single-location businesses with employment between 1 and 499 and payroll in 2018, 2019, or 2020. The number of active, in-scope businesses with valid email addresses totaled about 940,500 businesses. Approximately 91,000 email addresses were updated through a match to the databases used for processing monthly and annual economic surveys.
To maximize the use of available e-mail addresses, the Census Bureau used the full set of businesses with e-mail addresses from the Economic Census in the Small Business Pulse Survey. The initial weight for each unit with an e-mail address was set to the count of the total number units (both with and without email addresses) in the same state by 3-digit NAICS industry divided by the number of units in the same grouping with an e-mail address.
The full set of eligible businesses was divided into nine panels for the weekly e-mail invitations to respond to the survey. To establish panels of similar size and industry and geography distributions, the businesses with e-mail addresses were sorted by MSA and 2018 annual payroll within each state by 3-digit NAICS cell and then systematically assigned to one of the nine panels. and invites over 90,000 businesses to respond via email each week, reaching nearly one million small businesses across a 9-week rotation to reduce burden and lessen survey fatigue.

The Small Business Pulse Survey collects data on location closings, changes in employment, disruptions in the supply chain, the use of federal assistance programs, and expectations concerning future operations. This survey helps us to understand how small businesses are weathering the current crisis given business disruptions, stay-at-home orders, school closures, changes in the availability of consumer goods and consumer patterns, and other abrupt and significant changes to American life. In addition, the data produced will consist of national estimates as well as state, top 50 metro, and industry detail. These series will be particularly useful to small businesses making decisions about their future, policymakers as they seek to address challenges faced by these businesses, and researchers studying the impact and response to COVID-19.
