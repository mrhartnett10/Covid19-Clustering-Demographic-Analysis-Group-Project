## House Price Index
***
The House Price Index (HPI) measures the movement of single-family house prices in the United States. Using data supplied by Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) published House Price Index. Investors use this economic indicator to track economic trends and analyze shifts in stock market. It is also used as an analytical tool for estimating housing mortgage, prepayments, and housing affordability. The FHFA HPI is based on millions of homes sales and provides insight about house price changes at various geographical levels. The fluctuations in housing prices have impact on economy. An increase on housing price boosts job market which results in higher consumer spending. This paper considers three attributes of House Price Index which is defined below.
